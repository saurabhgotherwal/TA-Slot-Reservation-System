# TA-slot-Reservation-System-

### Objective:

At large U.S. universities, undergraduate course enrollments often exceed 400 students. Even with a team of
undergraduate TAs, these courses can still have 30+ students per staff member. Without a way of organizing students,
office hour attendance can overwhelm the TAs. Efficiency is reduced and fairness problems created as this congestion
prevents TAs from dividing their time equally among students. (This is not a problem for faculty office hours, however.)

This situation could be improved by a well-designed reservation system. Under this system, office hours would be split into
discrete time blocks with the schedule of those blocks posted publicly. Students would which times a TA will be available
and could reserve one of the open times. To support TAs, the system would maintain a queue of students holding current
reservations. By working from the queue, the TAs could be efficient in meeting with as many students as possible. Fairness
would be ensured by limiting how often students can sign up for reservations and applying appropriate sanctions for
students who do not show up for an appointment.

To address this issue, I have created this application. The current version of this application enables the TA to view and attend all the students who have registered for the slot.
